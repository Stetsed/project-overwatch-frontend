# Project Overwatch Frontend

Project Overwatch is a project to allow the surveillance and replaying of the dynmap information from a minecraft servers dynmap. It combines a [Rust Scanner](https://github.com/stetsed-org/project-overwatch-scanner) which logs all data to the pocketbase backend. After which you have the frontend which is written with the below technologies to allow people to browse the information collected, such as finding who has been at a specific coordinates since a specific time, a heatmap to see since the date given where everybody has been. It is a hobby project I made in a short period for a Minecraft Server I played on.
