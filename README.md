# Project Overwatch Frontend

This is a project which I wipped up quickly to allow me to (from a database) check if anybody has been within +/- 20 blocks of the given coords since the time given and with an authorization token. This is the frontend part which is built with Svelte and Typescript. It has a nav bar and the "Overwatch" page which let's you enter the X and Y coordinates, the date since, and the authorization token which it then sends to the backend which you can find [here](https://github.com/Stetsed/project-overwatch-backend)
